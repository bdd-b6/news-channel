<p>September 11th is always an emotional and somber day at the NYSE and across the country. Many of the people who work
    for or at the exchange were deeply affected by the events of that day. Those memories will forever be etched in our
    minds. As we approach the 21st anniversary of this tragic event our thoughts and prayers are with the families of
    those lost and our eternal gratitude goes out to the first responders and service people who answered the call to
    duty. #NEVERFORGET</p>
